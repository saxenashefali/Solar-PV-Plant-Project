### Project Setup, Dependencies, and Execution Instructions

This README file provides instructions for setting up, understanding dependencies, and executing the provided code for solar power analysis and prediction.

#### Setup

1. **Python Installation**: Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download and install Python from the official [Python website](https://www.python.org/).

2. **Library Installation**: Install the required Python libraries using pip, Python's package installer. Open your terminal or command prompt and execute the following command:

   ```
   pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn pvlib
   ```

#### Dependencies

- `pandas`: Data manipulation and analysis library.
- `numpy`: Numerical computing library.
- `seaborn`: Statistical data visualization library based on matplotlib.
- `matplotlib`: Data visualization library.
- `scikit-learn`: Machine learning library.
- `pvlib`: Library for simulating solar photovoltaic energy production.

#### Execution Instructions

1. **Data Loading**: Ensure that the CSV files (`Plant_2_Generation_Data.csv` and `Plant_2_Weather_Sensor_Data.csv`) are located in the same directory as your Python script or notebook.

2. **Code Execution**: Copy the provided code into your Python script or notebook.

3. **Run the Code**: Execute the script or notebook to run the code. Ensure that the necessary libraries are imported at the beginning of your script or notebook.

4. **Interpret Results**: After running the code, interpret the results from the visualizations, model evaluation metrics, and solar power predictions provided in the output.

By following these setup, dependencies, and execution instructions, you can analyze solar power generation data and make predictions for future power output effectively. Adjustments to the code or further exploration can be made based on specific requirements or use cases.
